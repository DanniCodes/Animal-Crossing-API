        <h2>What is Animal Crossing?</h2>
        
        <p>Animal Crossing is a popular life simulation game series developed by Nintendo. In the game, players live in a charming village inhabited by anthropomorphic animals. Players can decorate their homes, interact with villagers, and engage in various activities like fishing, bug catching, and gardening. Each villager has a unique personality, making the game a fun and relaxing experience for all ages.</p>

        <h2>Our Project</h2>
        
        <p>For our technical course in systems development, we are creating a website that utilizes an Animal Crossing API. The site allows users to search for various villagers and learn more about them. The goal of this project is to practice web development skills while integrating external data through an API, combining creativity and technical expertise.</p>
